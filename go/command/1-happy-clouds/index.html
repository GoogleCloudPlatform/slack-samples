    <h2>Example Slash Command</h2>
    <p>This is an example of a
      <a href="https://api.slack.com/slash-commands">slash command</a>
      for Slack. To set it up as a command:
      <ol>
        <li>Create a <a href="https://api.slack.com/apps">new Slack app</a>.</li>
        <li>Configure a slash command and point it at the URL for <a
            href="/quotes/random">/quotes/random</a>.</li>
        <li>Modify config.go with the verification token on the basic
          information page of the app configuration to verify that requests are
          coming from Slack.</li>
      </ol>
